/* Responsive notes:
   Generating full responsive-prefixed copies for every utility is intentionally omitted
   to keep the distributed CSS size reasonable. Use the SASS mixin `@include sb-up('md')`
   in component SCSS to apply breakpoint-specific rules, or run an optional PostCSS step
   to produce responsive variants for a selected subset of utilities.
